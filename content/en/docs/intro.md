[Opereon](https://opereon.io) is an open source tool for automatic orchestration of resources in ICT infrastructure.
It can be used to perform any administrative tasks on Unix-like hosts.

[Opereon](https://opereon.io) does not require any agent installed on the remote hosts, and uses internally an [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com)
client to perform remote administrative tasks. This ensures that everything works exactly as it would when the user
would perform the same tasks manually.

This documentation consists of several chapters.
