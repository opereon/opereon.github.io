Automated approach for system administration, if used efficiently, can provide significant benefits for the\norganization, like operational cost and/or risk reductions. On the other hand, the introduction of any solution\nfor IT automation will incur added cost of it's implementation within the organization. </p>\n<p>We thrive to provide and maintain our own <em>open-source</em> solution for <em>IT automation</em>, which we have designed and\nimplemented because we could not find an existing solution for our needs that would check all of the boxes. In the\nfollowing part we will present our product and discuss its features in comparison to the existing popular solutions.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-opereon\"><a href=\"#what-is-opereon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>What is Opereon?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://opereon.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Opereon</a> is an open-source, free of charge, configuration management and automation system for IT,\nsimilar in function to the other solutions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.ansible.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ansible</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://puppet.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puppet</a>, <a href=\"https://puppet.com/products/bolt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bolt</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.chef.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chef</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.saltstack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SaltStack</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is essentially a remote task runner, capable of performing administrative tasks on hosts using Unix-like systems,\nusing SSH protocol. It does not require any particular software to be installed on the managed (remote) hosts, except\nof course for a working SSH server. Task are basically just system commands or shell scripts, so they can be implemented\nin any programming language the user sees fit. The tasks are implemented imperatively by the user, and they can have\ntriggers to be executed automatically when declarative part of the infrastructure definition changes. </p>\n<h2 id=\"why-opereon\"><a href=\"#why-opereon\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>Why Opereon?</h2>\n<p>Typically configuration management tools were designed around two fundamental approaches of representing what needs to be\nconfigured on remote hosts for the infrastructure to operate as required. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Declarative</em> (or functional), where the user typically defines <em>what</em> is the desired state of the infrastructure.\nThis approach is encouraged for instance by <a href=\"https://puppet.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Puppet</a> and <a href=\"https://www.saltstack.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SaltStack</a>.\n</li>\n<li><em>imperative</em> (procedural), where the user defined <em>how</em> the desired state is to be achieved  </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-opereon-works\"><a href=\"#how-opereon-works\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"icon icon-link\"></span></a>How Opereon works?</h2>\n","sidebar":"docs","next":"/docs/install/","prev":"/docs/quickstart/","headings":[{"depth":1,"value":"Overview","anchor":"#overview"},{"depth":2,"value":"What is Opereon?","anchor":"#what-is-opereon"},{"depth":2,"value":"Why Opereon?","anchor":"#why-opereon"},{"depth":2,"value":"How Opereon works?","anchor":"#how-opereon-works"}]},"allMarkdownPage":{"edges":[{"node":{"path":"/docs/procedures/","title":"Procedures"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/template/","title":"Templates"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/model/","title":"Data model"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/install/","title":"Installation"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/quickstart/","title":"Quick start"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/opath/","title":"Opath query language"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/overview/","title":"Overview"}},{"node":{"path":"/docs/","title":"Documentation"}}]}},"context":{}}
