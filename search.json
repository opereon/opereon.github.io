All of the necessary facts about\nmanaged hosts, users, services, etc. are represented by set of (mostly) textual files, that are easy to edit and\nmaintain.\nThe model is kept in a single\ngit\nrepository for change tracking. When used, the\ndata from files is then transformed into an generalized object tree, which can be traversed and searched with the use\nof our own specialized data query language\nOpath\n.\nIntroduction\nFor illustration purposes, consider the following directory, containing some crucial pieces of information about a very\nsimple infrastructure, with one host named\nserver1\nand one user account named\njohn\n.\n.\n├── hosts/\n│ └── server1/\n│ ├── etc/\n│ │ └── ssh/\n│ │ ├── ssh_host_rsa_key\n│ │ └── ssh_host_rsa_key.pub\n│ └── _.yaml\n└── users/\n└── john/\n├── ssh/\n│ └── id_rsa.pub\n└── _.json\nOf particular interest in this discussion are the files presented below:\nhosts/server1/_.yaml\nhostname\n:\nserver1\ndomain\n:\nexample.org\nnet\n:\neth0\n:\nip4\n:\naddress\n:\n192.168.1.100\nmask\n:\n255.255.255.0\ngateway\n:\n192.168.1.1\npackages\n:\n[\nmc\n,\nvim\n,\nnmap\n]\nusers/john/_.json\n{\n\"username\"\n:\n\"john\"\n,\n\"email\"\n:\n\"johnny@example.org\"\n,\n\"first_name\"\n:\n\"John\"\n,\n\"last_name\"\n:\n\"Smith\"\n}\nwhich contain some arbitrary metadata about the host\nserver1\nand the user\njohn\nrespectively.\nThe files in\nhosts/server1/etc/ssh/\nfolder contain private and public keys for SSH service on the host. It would be\ndesired in this example, that the actual SSH service keys, which are presumably kept in\n/etc/ssh\nfolder on the\nserver1\n,\nshould always be identical to those in the file structure. That way, in case of catastrophic hardware failure, the host can be\nrecreated on another hardware, with identical SSH fingerprint.\nAs it can be seen from the example, such file set can intuitively and efficiently store in a\ndeclarative manner\na desired\nconfiguration of the managed infrastructure. By changing some metadata inside the file set (for instance changing IP\naddress for the hosts) and running Opereon toolchain on the file set, that change should be performed on the actual host\nby executing a defined set of administrative tasks (like reconfiguring network interfaces).\nData representation\nFiles in the model can contain arbitrary JSON-like data (currently supported parsable formats include\nJSON\n,\nYAML\nand\nTOML\n).\nOther data formats are treated as binary files.\nAll of the files are transformed into an object tree in memory when in use by Opereon tools. The rules of this\ntransformation are configurable, as described below.\nManifest file\nAt the root of file tree representing data model for Opereon, there must be preset a manifest file. Manifest file is by\ndefault named\nop.toml\nop.toml\n[\ninfo\n]\nauthors\n=\n[\n\"John <johnny@example.org>\"\n,\n\"Mark <mark@example.org>\"\n]\ndescription\n=\n\"Server farm 1\"\n[\ndefines\n]\nusers\n=\n\"$.conf.users.*\"\nhosts\n=\n\"$.conf.hosts.*\"\nprocs\n=\n\"$.(proc, probe).**[@.proc != null]\"\nuser_defined_expr_1\n=\n\"$.**[custom_property == 'custom_value']\"\nSettings file\nEverywhere in the data model, a user can also define a file named\n.operc\n, containing settings used when reading the model\ninto the object tree. The settings are overwritten by a setting file in hierarchical fashion, for the folder in which the\n.operc\nfile is located, and its subfolders, unless further overwritten with nested\n.operc\nfiles.\nBy default, if no\n.operc\nfile is present anywhere in the model, the default settings are used, as presented below.\n.operc\ninherit_excludes\n=\ntrue\ninherit_includes\n=\ntrue\ninherit_overrides\n=\ntrue\n[\n[\nexclude\n]\n]\npath\n=\n\"**/.*/**\"\n[\n[\ninclude\n]\n]\npath\n=\n\"**/*\"\nfile_type\n=\n\"dir\"\nitem\n=\n\"${map()}\"\nmapping\n=\n\"${$.find(array($item.@file_path_components[..-2]).join('.')).set($item.@file_name, $item)}\"\n[\n[\ninclude\n]\n]\npath\n=\n\"**/_.{yaml,yml,toml,json}\"\nfile_type\n=\n\"file\"\nitem\n=\n\"${loadFile(@.@file_path, @.@file_ext)}\"\nmapping\n=\n\"${$.find(array($item.@file_path_components[..-2]).join('.')).extend($item)}\"\n[\n[\ninclude\n]\n]\npath\n=\n\"**/*.{yaml,yml,toml,json}\"\nfile_type\n=\n\"file\"\nitem\n=\n\"${loadFile(@.@file_path, @.@file_ext)}\"\nmapping\n=\n\"${$.find(array($item.@file_path_components[..-2]).join('.')).set($item.@file_stem, $item)}\"\n[\n[\ninclude\n]\n]\npath\n=\n\"**/*\"\nfile_type\n=\n\"file\"\nitem\n=\n\"${loadFile(@.@file_path, 'text')}\"\nmapping\n=\n\"${$.find(array($item.@file_path_components[..-2]).join('.')).set($item.@file_stem, $item)}\"\n[\noverrides\n]\n# no overrides\n"},{"path":"/docs/opath/","title":"Opath query language","content":"Opath query language\nOpath is a simple language for object tree lookup and transformation, similar to\nXPath\nin function.\nData types\nAll data types transferable through\njson\n,\nyaml\nand\ntoml\nformats are supported.\nnull\n- empty value\nnumber\n- internally stored as either 64-bit integer or 64-bit float\nboolean\n-\ntrue\nor\nfalse\nstring\n- strings are stored as UTF-8 encoded data.\nbinary\n- binary data.\nobject\n- object or map, can contain string-keyed properties\narray\n- array or sequence of elements\nLiterals\n123\n,\n-2\n- 64-bit integer values\n1.13\n,\n.e10\n,\n-1E-2\n,\n.3\n- 64-bit float values\n'id'\n,\n\"id\"\n- string values\ntrue\n,\nfalse\n- boolean values\nnull\n- null value\nType conversions\nSame as ECMAScript, integers are promoted to floats when mixed operands are used.\nMathematical operators\nTypical mathematical operators and parentheses are supported.\n2 + 3\n,\n@.count + 1\n- numerical addition\n2 - 3\n,\n@.count - 1\n- numerical subtraction\n2 * 3\n,\n@.count * 2\n- numerical multiplication\n2 / 3\n,\n@.count / 2\n- numerical division\n2 + 6 / 2\n- yields value\n5\n, as expected\n(2 + 6) / 2\n- yields value\n4\nInternally, type conversion is avoided as long as possible, i.e. adding two integer values will yield integer sum.\nString concatenation\nIf any of the addition operands has a string value, addition will become string concatenation\n2 + \"3\"\n,\n\"2\" + 3\n- both expressions yield string value\n\"23\"\n\"John\" + \" \" + 'Doe'\n- yields\n\"John Doe\"\nComparison operators\n2 > 3\n2 >= 3\n2 < 3\n2 <= 3\n2 == 3\n2 != 3\n'aaabbb' ^= 'aa'\n-\ntrue\nif left string operand starts with right string operand\n'aaabbb' *= 'aa'\n-\ntrue\nif left string operand contains right string operand\n'aaabbb' $= 'bb'\n-\ntrue\nif left string operand ends with right string operand\nLogical operators\nnot true\n,\n!true\ntrue and true\n,\ntrue && true\ntrue or true\n,\ntrue || true\nNumber ranges\n:10\n- range from\n0\n(inclusive) to\n10\n(inclusive)\n1:10\n- range from\n1\n(inclusive) to\n10\n(inclusive)\n0:2:10\n- range from\n0\n(inclusive) to\n10\n(inclusive) with\n2\nincrements\n5:-0.1:-1.4\n- floats in ranges are also supported\n1..10\n- range from\n1\n(inclusive) to\n10\n(inclusive)\n..10\n- range from\n0\n(inclusive) to\n10\n(inclusive)\nContext\nEvery\nOpath\nexpression is executed in the context of\nroot\n(denoted\n$\n) and\ncurrent\n(denoted\n@\n) elements.

For example if\ncurrent\nobject will be:\n{\n\"first_name\"\n:\n\"John\"\n,\n\"last_name\"\n:\n\"Doe\"\n}\nexpression\n@[1]\nwill yield string value\n\"Doe\"\n(value of the secod property).
